# Intermediate products / parts

Parts are needed for most T2 and T3 construction processes. Every order you fabricate gives you a batch of 10 parts (So when you build 1x large hull II, you get 10 large hull II parts).

Once you get into T3 parts production, you will need a new resource type called gas. This can be found from two sources:
The various liaison factions sell 4 x 250 gas per day (Iyatequa has gas E, Tanoch have gas F and the Yaot have gas G)
It also drops from T3 scannable missions, this is also you only source for gas H
- A farm route for this is as followed: Zaatas, Vaal, Ixtpec, Sijin, Topa, Rama, Tenjaca - relic signatures
