# Modules- weapons and sensors

- Because we don't have the drop %'s of all locations, I won't add them for now. But for those containers that we do have (Strikes and freighter containers) can be found here on the mirrored google doc: shorturl.at/kSTV0 (On the loot container tab)

## Sensor arrays

Sensor array modules can be equipped to your flagship to help the player with scanning objects within a system. They do not affect targeting range or weapon range.
Sensors can be buffed by upgrading them, fitting in a high aerospace stat officer (buffs scan strength) or fitting in Comms Officers (passive perks).

## Kinetics / Capital mass drivers weapons

Kinetic or CMD weapons are ballistic weapons that go bang bang. With decent hull and armour damage, they are a jack-of-all-trades of the various weapon types. They have two active abilities called Kinetic Burst and EMP Round (from Operator officers).
They can be buffed by upgrading them, fitting in a high physical stat officer (buffs both hull and armour damage), a CMD gunner (passive perks) or completing kinetic research upgrades.
- Tanoch Kinetics Have a higher fire rate, but a shorter range compared to the normal / Hiigaran variant
- Kinetics always deal full damage no matter the range, but the hit chance drastically falls off the further the enemy is away.

## Missiles weapons

Missiles (not to be confused with torpedo's) are a weapon type that go fwoosh boom. With mostly hull damage and very little armour damage, they will shred any unarmoured targets but struggle with armoured enemies. They have two active abilities called Missile Barrage and Fusion Missile (from Operator officers).
They can be buffed by upgrading them, fitting in a high aerospace stat officer (buffs weapon range), a missile gunner (passive perks) and completing missile research upgrades.
- All missiles always deal full damage no matter the range. 
- The small missiles have very high hit chances at close range but drop off drastically at maximum range. 
- Medium and large have hit penalties at close range, but are drastically better at long range.

## Torpedo weapons

Torpdoe's (not to be confused with missiles) are a weapon type that go fwoosh BOOM. With mixed hull damage and armour damage, they can give you a decent mix of damage against larger targets. They can be buffed by upgrading them, fitting in a high aerospace stat officer (buffs weapon range). Currently there are no officers with perks or abilities for torpedo's
- To emphasize their sluggishness, they have a low hit chance at close range but have a 95% hit chance at medium and max range. They always deal full damage at any range

## Ion weapons

Ion weapons are beam type weapons that go vooomm. With mostly armour damage and less hull damage compared to the other weapon types, they are meant to counter armoured targets like capital ships and structures. They have one ability called Ion Cannon Shot (from Operator officers).
They can be buffed by upgrading them, fitting in a high physical stat officer (buffs both hull and armour damage), an ion gunner (passive perks) and completing beam research upgrades.
-Ions are beam weapons, to emphasize their use as long-range weapons, their hit chance increases with range and maxes at around 80% of the maximum distance.

## Pulsar weapons

Pulsar weapons are beam type weapons that go pew zap. Similar to the ion weapons, they have mostly armour damage and less hull damage compared to the other weapon types, but they have a faster fire rate and different officers then their beam cousins. They have one active abilities called Pulsar Burst (from Operator officers).
They can be buffed by upgrading them, fitting in a high physical stat officer (buffs both hull and armour damage), a pulsar gunner (passive perks) and completing beam research upgrades.
- Yaot pulsars have more damage and range, but a lower fire rate compared to the normal / Hiigaran variant
- Pulsars are beam weapons, to emphasize their use as long-range weapons, their hit chance increases with range and maxes at around 80% of the maximum distance.

## Repair modules

Repair modules are 'healing' turrets that go brrrt hummmm. They will repair units in your fleet within range if they have damaged armour (So keep in mind, just your unit, not friendlies. Also, they will only auto repair armour, not hull). They have one ability called Repair Burst that will also repair the armour of friendly units (from Operator officers).
They can be buffed by upgrading them and fitting in a high aerospace stat officer (buffs the range of the module)
- WARNING using repair modules might pull a lot of agro towards your flagship when they are active. Keep this in mind when doing strikes or harder content

## Internal modules

Internal modules are various boost that can buff up your flagship, from additional fabrication or refinery slots, to weapon boosts that gives you insane total stats, internal modules are the way to go for both min-maxers as new players alike. Every flagship has a front, middle and back slots to place modules in. 
Every flagship has a base capacity of 170 front, 220 middle and 170 back. But T1 flagships and higher get a 50+ boost depending on the class of the flagship. 
- Explorer will get +50 front (so 220 front, 220 middle and 170 back)
- carriers will get +50 middle (170, 270, 170)
- battlecruisers will get +50 back (170, 220, 220) 
 
A higher tier modules doesn't mean that the module itself is stronger (aside from fabricators and refineries), but the higher the tier, the lower the capacity cost of the module will be.
