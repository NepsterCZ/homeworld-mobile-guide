# Modules- weapons and sensors

## Sensor arrays

Sensor array modules can be equipped to your flagship to help the player with scanning objects within a system. They do not affect targeting range or weapon range.
Sensors can be buffed by upgrading them, fitting in a high aerospace stat officer (buffs scan strength) or fitting in Comms Officers (passive perks).

## Kinetics / Capital mass drivers weapons

Kinetic or CMD weapons are ballistic weapons that go bang bang. With decent hull and armour damage, they are a jack-of-all-trades of the various weapon types. They have two active abilities called Kinetic Burst and EMP Round (from Operator officers).
They can be buffed by upgrading them, fitting in a high physical stat officer (buffs both hull and armour damage), a CMD gunner (passive perks) or completing kinetic research upgrades.
- Tanoch Kinetics Have a higher fire rate, but a shorter range compared to the normal / Hiigaran variant

## Missiles weapons

Missiles (not to be confused with torpedo's) are a weapon type that go fwoosh boom. With mostly hull damage and very little armour damage, they will shred any unarmoured targets but struggle with armoured enemies. They have two active abilities called Missile Barrage and Fusion Missile (from Operator officers).
They can be buffed by upgrading them, fitting in a high aerospace stat officer (buffs weapon range), a missile gunner (passive perks) and completing missile research upgrades.

## Ion weapons

Ion weapons are beam type weapons that go zooooom. With mostly armour damage and less hull damage compared to the other weapon types, they are meant to counter armoured targets like capital ships and structures. They have one ability called Ion Cannon Burst (from Operator officers).
They can be buffed by upgrading them, fitting in a high physical stat officer (buffs both hull and armour damage), an ion gunner (passive perks) and completing beam research upgrades.

## Pulsar weapons

Pulsar weapons are beam type weapons that go pew zap. Similar to the ion weapons, they have mostly armour damage and less hull damage compared to the other weapon types, but they have a faster fire rate and different officers then their beam cousins. Currently there is no ability for pulsar weapons.
They can be buffed by upgrading them, fitting in a high physical stat officer (buffs both hull and armour damage), a pulsar gunner (passive perks) and completing beam research upgrades.
- Yaot pulsars have more damage and range, but a lower fire rate compared to the normal / Hiigaran variant

## Repair modules

Repair modules weirdly enough don't make a sound, so no cheeky joke there. They will repair units in your fleet within range if they have damaged armour (So keep in mind, just your unit, not friendlies. Also, they will only auto repair armour, not hull). They have one ability called Repair Burst that will also repair the armour of friendly units (from Operator officers).
They can be buffed by upgrading them and fitting in a high aerospace stat officer (buffs the range of the module)
