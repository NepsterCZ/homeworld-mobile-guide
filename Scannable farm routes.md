## Scannable farm routes
Since scanable missions seem to be static to each system, and the 1st scanned system is 'refreshed' after a 7th system has been scanned, you can make yourself a farm route for different mission types. Down below is my farm route for Tanoch signal missions, which consists of 5 systems which have at least 1 signal mission, and 2 systems that have the most scanable objects to progress the sensor side missions as well:

### Tanoch farm route
- Kisho Re T2
- Saaret T2
- Cival Tem (+2 after clearing one and scanning again) T2
- Torugul Nai T2
- Ytep T3
- Devedaasi (no signals)
- Jishin (no signals)

### Sensor farm route
- Devedaasi - 12 belts
- Jishin - 8 belts
- Ekaam Nar - 7 belts
- Jol Ataain - 9 belts
- Torugul Nai - 7 belts
- Xelasii - 8 belts
- Furlaan - 8 belts

### T3 Progenitor farm route
- Vaal - 1st scan relic signature
- Briuun - 1st scan relic signature
- Dasolat Tem - 2nd scan Progenitor Signal
- Philoraan Tem - 1st scan relic signature (1st result in list, not 2nd. Keep scanning till you have 2 signatures)
- Darodiir - 2nd scan relic signature
- Nevopan - 1st scan relic signature
- Ytep - 1st scan relic signature (2 results both progenitors)
