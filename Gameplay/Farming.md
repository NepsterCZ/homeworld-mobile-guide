## Scannable farm routes
Since scanable missions seem to be static to each system, and the 1st scanned system is 'refreshed' after a 7th system has been scanned, you can make yourself a farm route for different mission types. Down below is my farm route for Epic signal missions, which consists of 6 systems which have a epic signal mission, and 1 system that resests the first scanned location.

### T3
- Zaatas, Cangacian Signal Alpha (1st scan)
- Hakna Mir, Tanoch Signal Gamma (2nd scan)
- Mako Nar, Yaot Signal Alpha (2nd scan)
- Darodiir, Cangacian Signal Beta (2nd scan)

### T2
- Jol Altaain, Yaot Signal Alpha (1st scan)
- Kamaani, Yaot Signal Alpha (2nd scan)

And to reset, any other system will do. For example Xelasii or Torugul Nai for the additional scan progresion

- BE AWARE that epic missions are some of the hardest missions out there. So make sure you are equipped to deal with a lot of strikes craft, and tanky frigates / destroyer class enemies
- In order of difficulty, easy to hard: T2 Yaot, T3 Cangacian, T3 Tanoch, T3 Yaot
