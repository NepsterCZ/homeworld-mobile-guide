## Scannable farm routes
Since scanable missions seem to be static to each system, and the 1st scanned system is 'refreshed' after a 7th system has been scanned, you can make yourself a farm route for different mission types. Down below is my farm route for Epic signal missions, which consists of 6 systems which have a epic signal mission, and 1 system that resests the first scanned location.

### T3
- Sabio, Cangacian Signal Alpha (1st scan)
- Ziipage, Cangacian Signal Alpha (1st scan)
- Ytep, Yaot Signal Alpha (2nd scan)
- Cuilan, Yaot Signal Beta (1st scan) WARNING tough mission
- Zaatas, Yaot Signal (1st scan)

### T2
- Tlapan, Yaot Signal Beta (2nd scan)

And to reset, any other system will do

- BE AWARE that epic missions are some of the hardest missions out there. So make sure you are equipped to deal with a lot of strikes craft, and tanky frigates / destroyer class enemies
