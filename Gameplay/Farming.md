# Farming

## Scannable farm routes
Since scanable missions seem to be static to each system, and the 1st scanned system is 'refreshed' after a 7th system has been scanned, you can make yourself a farm route for different mission types.
Down below are all the epic missions that are found so far, if there are any error or I missed something, please let me know!
