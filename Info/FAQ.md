# Frequently Asked Questions & Basic Info

## Basic Info
### What Kiithid / faction should I choose?
With the current game balance, all kiithid are a viable choice. The buff and debuffs you get from them are minimal, so choose which group you like the most lore or colour scheme wise
Same can be said for the weapons and units, the balance right now is pretty solid so dont be afraid to pick whatever you want

### What are tiers / where to find Tx loot?
In the current version, there are three tiers, tier 1 (T1), tier 2 (T2) and tier 3 (T3). These are marked with Roman numerals (so T1 is I, T2 II, T3 III). Every item, location, enemy and mission has a designated tier to it.
If you're looking for a certain tier item (lets say T2 ores), you'll find it in a tier 2 system, marked with II (so for example Bishaan Tel II). If a mission requires you to build a T2 interceptor, look for the II on the top right of the blueprint

### Where can I find large Weapons / Hull / Machinery parts blueprint?
Since the introduction of requisitions, the different blueprints can be found in the requisitions stores of the different factions. Large weapon parts blueprints can be found from the Tanoch stations (Stations in the red zone, Gero Niir for example)
Large hull parts blueprints can be found from the Yaot stations (Stations in the green zone, Xelasii for example) and the large machinery blueprints can be found from the Iyatequa stations (the zone without colour, Bishaan tel for example)

### My game crashed after buying IRL purchases / I don't see my bought packs?
Currently only android devices / accounts are able to buy IRL purchases. iOS devices seem to crash when attempting to buy something. This is due to testflight being a bit weird.
For android devices, you'll find the bought items in your ships storage (internal view -> storage). If this is not the case, double check if you see the 'sold out' tag on packs.
If this tag is not present, then you might want to try a different payment method (if money has been withdrawn, the playstore will refund you in a 24h timespan). If this is present but you still don't have the items (after a reset)? Make a ticket in the #bug-report channel

### I can't progress the main quest anymore / main quest missions are too hard?
The main quest is not meant to be progressed or rushed with back to back missions. If you feel like your fleet is too weak, take a bit of time off to mine and complete other missions to get stronger before attempting the main mission again
Without spoilers, once you reach the 'Temple Tonaati' mission, you'll notice a big difficulty spike. Make sure your fleet is strong enough and / or be ready to jump out when the battle is not in your favor. Also, stock up on armour damage for a certain reason ;)

### My camera is stuck / can't pan my camera anymore?
Sometimes during extended sessions, your camera can become stuck. There are two ways to fix it: 1. Jump to a node within a system (trade station to an asteroid belt for example) and rapidly press the top right and bottom left of the screen. This should unstuck your camera (the longer the distance, the better the chances). 2. Is the good old 'have you tried turning it off and on again' approach. This will instantly fix the camera issue.

### Where can I scan something / where to find the scan button?
In your system overview (On the top right, the 3rd button from the right) you can scan missions and locations. Press the scan button on the button left to start send your first ever ping across the system.

## Mining & Upgrades
### Can I mine without being attacked / Any tips for mining?
Yes and no. By completing a scannable mission or a strike, you can stay in that instance and mine the asteroids that are present there. But the mining yield of those asteroid are abysmal because of its low purity.
To increase your mining yield, you need to scan down an asteroid belt (marked with a triangle on the map, check the System list tab). Those asteroids have 10x the purity then those in missions. But you'll be attack by pirates when you stay long enough in that instance. And most belts will have continuously spawns
You can ask in global chat for help whilst mining, players tend to farm those pirate spawns so whilst you are safly mining away, another player can take care of the pirates for you
Popular mining systems are: Jishun for T1, Bishaan tel for T2 and Darodiir for T3

### My scanner does not work / button is greyed out? (Could be fixed in 2.49)
Scanning something down can be a bit difficult depending on your sensors array. Spamming the scan button does work if you for example have a T1 sensors array and you want to scan down a T2 site
If your scan button grey's out and is no longer press able, then you've encountered a known bug. A fix for this is to restart your game client.
To upgrade your sensors array, you can use RE to lvl it up, get a higher tier sensors array or fit in a high aerospace stat officer into your sensors room

### Do asteroids deplete / how long can I mine them?
Asteroid do not deplete. So keep shooting rocks to your hearts content!

### Where can I find D type ore? Asteroid identification
Every ore type can be found in every belt. But it won't always show up in your list. When going into a scanned asteroid belt, you'll see a ore type that is focused in the system map. This only decides the Majority of the asteroids present but not all. The 4 asteroid types have  distinct looks, with D type being capped on a lower purity then the other types.
A type has reddish looks to them, B type is silvery, C type is green and orange whilst D type is completely brown, and is faded on the sensors manager compared to the other types.
Now as stated before, those asteroids won't always show up on your asteroid list. But no worries, every asteroid that shows up on your sensors manager is mine-able. By dragging and dropping your mining units on an asteroid, you can manually mine the types not present in your list.

- For images on asteroid identification, please go to the Mirrored Google doc: shorturl.at/cdiDF

### Where can I find RE / Which asteroid type gives the most RE?
RE is a side-product from mining asteroids, and can be dropped from strike loot and progenitor salvage. But mining asteroids will be your main source
After numerous tests, the RE drop rate don't seem to differ from the different types. The most important thing is the asteroid's purity, which decides the drop quantity of RE
Aside from mining, there are also options in the market to get RE's from each tiers. If you're planning to play for a long time, I recommend you to buy the T3 cache as early as you can since the drop rate is really low when mining

### Where can I find a specific RE / What RE's do I need?
Each tier has its own RE's. If you're looking to upgrade a T1 weapon, you'll need to find yourself T1 RE's.
Currently the following RE's are in the game in order of rarity: T1: Sc, Yy (both needed for weapons and utilities) T2: La (Weapons and utilities), Ce (Weapons), Pr (Utilities). T3: Nd (Utilities), Pm (Weapons), Sm (Weapons), Eu (Utilities)

### My collectors are dropping off ores to another player / how many resource collectors do I need?
A players' flagship and resource controllers get a drop off point for resource collectors. When your collectors are mining close to the fleet of another player, they will try to drop off their ores into their drop off point. When collectors do this, the ores they mine will be yours, the reverse can also happen when another players collectors drop off into your drop off point. Rule of thumb is that whatever YOUR collectors mine will be YOURS, THEIR collectors ores will be THEIRS.
Currently a instance have a maximum cap for mining units (collectors and controllers). If there are 10 units present, other players can't deploy their own. So in general if you are mining with other players, keep in mind to evenly split the mining units
Testing shows that collectors will only drop off their ores one at the time, excluding the amount of drop off points available. Meaning that if you have 2 controllers active, the collectors at controller B will wait until the drop off at controller A is finished
So TLDR; if you are mining in a group, 1 controller and 4 collectors is a good mix so other players can deploy units as well (reduce units if more players want to mine). If solo, deploy as many units as you want

### How do I earn credits / adamant?
Credits can be earned by various activities in the game, but there are methods that really help:
Early on, you can mine T1 resources, make T1 interceptors and sell those on the market. This is currently a very fast and easy way to earn some creds
When you unlock T2 small components, make and sell those instead of the T1 interceptors. This will net you more credits
If you're strong enough, you can camp the frigate spawn point on pirate hideout T1 strike for xp farming. Level-up rewards give out generous credit caches
Power-leveling is also the best method to get yourself adamant. Aside from the daily cache and rare drops from progenitor salvage, xp farming will net you a lot of adamant

## Blueprints
### Building parts & component requirements
When you start building your first T2 gear, you will notice that it takes multiple components. You can find where to get the blueprints for the components on the tab 'Intermediate Products'
Every 'order' you build, is 25 parts. This is for both small and large parts. So if you're building 10 small hull part orders, after the order is done, you get 250 parts in your inventory

### Where can I find xyz blueprint?
See the tabs above this page. "Ships" shows you the location of all flagships, escorts and strike craft. "Modules" shows you the location of various flagship specific gear

### Where can I find the T2 interceptor blueprint?
The blueprint for the T2 interceptor can be bought for credits in the market at a trading station (all stations have a shared inventory). Scroll down till you see the option for the normal blueprint (non-common / rarity T2 interceptors also work)

### What is the difference between a T1 and a T2 resource collectors?
Resource collectors have hidden stats. Higher tier collectors can mine higher tier ores faster. They also have more speed and repair more hull and armour per repair tick

### Which is better, x or y?
All flagships, escorts, strike craft and weapons have their pro and cons. It's up to you to look for a build that you like, or find what you need within your fleet

## Officers & Research
### Where can I find officers? What do the stats / perks do?
Most content in the game has a chance to drop officers. Scannable missions - token of gratitude, liaison rewards, strikes, weekly missions and salvage from enemies drop officers
There are also daily / weekly purchasable officers in the market. With the daily on costing credits and weekly ones costing adamant
For info on what officers do, see the tab 'Officers List & explanation' in this document (starts at E2). Note that officer with active abilites are quite rare, but still drop from the same locations as the other officers
Officer Cryopods have a chance to give you a higher rarity then the rarity of the item, with chances increasing with a higher rarity pod (So a common pod has a lower chance to drop an epic as to a rare pod).
After level 420, Cryopod Level Up Rewards are structured so that every 60 levels, the minimum rarity is Rare, and on the 300 level mark, the minimum is Epic.

### Should I level up my officers / can I sell my insignias?
Yes and no, in the early game leveling up your officers will be way to costly for its benefit. Use the credits for other upgrades like blueprints from the market. Do yourself a favor and DON'T sell your insignias. This will be a bottleneck for late game in which you need thousands upon thousands of them for your crew. More info on this in the 'Officer List & explanation' tab.

### How do you get Research points (RP)?
Research points are automatically generated in your research lab. Go to your internal view -> research. In there you can see a number on the left stating xxx RP available. Press that to collect it.
Note that you can't collect RP when you're researching something. RP will still be generated on the background but can only be collected after the research upgrade is done and the slot is free.

### How do I get more research?
There are 3 different tiers of the various research upgrades. T1 research is unlocked by doing your main story quests, and by lvling up (until level 420, after that no more T1 research drops)
For T2 and T3 research, you'll need to do missions. Liaisons, scanabales and strikes all have a chance to drop research upgrades for that tier of missions

### What do the different research upgrades do / what is the complete research list?
Research upgrade will buff your fleet in various ways, down below is the list of all research upgrades currently in the game. With the exception of the pulsar corvette, all research upgrades have a T1, T2 and T3 variant.
For clarity sake, the different tiers of research stack with each other. So for example, a T1 interceptor will benefit from T1, T2 and T3 research. Units above or below the tier of a research upgrade will still be effected by them.
- Pulsar corvette T1 blueprint: Unlocks the infinite common blueprint for T1 Pulsar corvettes (this is the only upgrade that unlocks a blueprint, the rest are pure stat upgrades)
- Beam armor damage: Increases the armor damage on flagship pulsar and ion weapons, pulsar corvettes, Yaot pulsar fighters and the Yaot assault frigate by 5%

- Kinetic armor damage: Increases the armor damage on your flagship kinetic weapons and destroyer damage by 5%
- Kinetic hull damage: Increases the hull damage on your flagship kinetic weapons and destroyer damage by 5%
- Kinetic range: Increases the range on your flagship kinetic weapons by 5%
- Mining yield: Increases the yield of all ore types of the tier from that research upgrade by 10% (so a T2 upgrade gives additional yield for T2 ores)
- Missile armor damage: Increases the armor damage on your flagship missile weapons and the Tanoch missile corvette by 5%
- Missile hull damage: Increases the hull damage on your flagship missile weapons and the Tanoch missile corvette by 5%
- Missile range: Increases the range on your flagship missile weapons by 5%

- Torpedo armor damage: Increases the armor damage for torpedo based units (torpedo frigate and the T2 / T3 Hiigaran destroyer) by 5%
- Torpedo hull damage: Increases the hull damage for torpedo based units (torpedo frigate and the T2 / T3 Hiigaran destroyer) by 5%
- Torpedo range: Increases the range for torpedo based weapons (currently no effect in game) by 5%

In total there are 103 research upgrades. 102 of those are stat based upgrades (34 categories and 3 tiers per category) and the last one is the T1 Pulsar corvette common blueprint unlock

## Strikes & Destroyers
### How do I find strikes / join strikes?
The most stable way to do strikes in a group, is using the lobby system. Clicking on your current objective, or going into your internal view -> bridge -> 3rd button on the left will show you the assignment log
Now in the strike tab, you can see several strike. When clicking on one you see a join button. When pressing that, you open a lobby or join an existing one.
Depending on how many people are active, just sitting in a lobby will most likely not help to find yourself new people, so global chat or the #strike-lobby channel on discord is the way to go
In global chat, you'll see players posting things like 'SDT2 open' or 'PRT3 up'. These are acronyms for what strikes people are doing for what tier
PH = Pirate hideout, SD = Station defense and PR = Pahra's rock

### I'm not seeing certain strike, missing strikes?
Some strikes are locked behind the main story quests. If you're missing certain strikes that other players do have, progress through the main quest line.
In this current version, the following strikes are availble: Pirate hideout (T1), Station defense (T2), Pahra's rock (T2), Pirate hideout Heroic (T2), Station defense Heroic (T3) and Pahra's rock Heroic (T3)

### I've built a destroyer, but can't find it anywhere
Destroyers take up 2 escort slots for fielding one. So if you are either running a T1 flagship, or already have an escort equipped in a T2/3 flagship, you don't see it in your escort roster

### Which is stronger, a destroyer or 2x frigates?
Both units serve a different purpose. The destroyer is mainly a tank, and has an impressive armour and hull pool. But its damage is lower than 2 frigates of the same tier and rarity.
So it depends what your fleet needs, do you need a tank or do you want more dps?

### I'm new to strikes, what should I do?
On the tab 'Strike guide' you can find info on the different strikes, tactics used, loadouts recommended and a guide on how to do them solo.

## Weapons and Aggro Issues
### My weapon dont seem to fire / animations are broken?
Weapon animations can be a bit wacky at times, weapons can have 10x the ordnance then normal. As long as you still do damage, then it's just a graphical problem
If your weapons don't seem to do damage, it might be that your flagship or units are targeting an enemy that is outside of your weapon range. Re-target an enemy within your range to start blasting again

### My flagship is being targeted down, what is happening?
Normally the enemy AI will target the first unit they see in their range, and switch between targets ever so often. But there is an issue with repair modules and repairing in general.
If you have a repair module equipped on your flagship and you are repairing a unit, enemies will instantly target you down. Same happens to collectors who repair units mid fight. This can be a death sentence for strike and higher tier content
Unless you're trying to tank a strike, its advised to un-equip repair turrets before going into them. This way the enemies will spread damage across the fleets of all players present.

## End of Beta / Release
### When does the beta end / when is release?
Fall of 2022 is the predicted release date for Homeworld Mobile.

### Do I keep my progress after the beta?
Yes and no, ALL progress will be reset on launch of the game, except for the IRL purchases made (bought packs, adamant or daily resource caches). These will be given to your account upon release
