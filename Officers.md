## Officer Stats & Perks

Officers in HWM give various buffs depending on the location they are placed in, what stats they have and if they have passive perks or active abilities. The three stats that officer have, are Physical, Mind and Aerospace.the green square.

### Physical
- Kinetic weapons (Light twin battery, standard battery, heavy battery). It gives a damage buff to both hull and armour damage						
- Mining yield increase for collectors (when slotted into a resource collectors slot)	
- Remote mining yield for controllers (when slotted into a resource controller slot)	
- Armour damage buff for escort ships (when slotted into the escort itself)			

### Mind
- Ion weapons (Standard ion cannon, heavy twin ion cannon). It gives a damage buff to both hull and armour damage						
- Fabrication time reduction for orders						
- Refinery time reduction for orders						
- Research time reduction for upgrades						

### Aerospace
- Missile weapons (Light missiles, standard missiles, fusion missiles). It increases the range of the turret						
- Repair turrets (light (Mohaava) repair module, standard (Mohaava) repair module) It increases the range of the turret						
- Engines, increase in speed and acceleration						
- Sensors array, increase the scan strength for both system and galaxy				
- Strike craft damage, increase for both hull and armour damage of a (combat) strike craft						

Additionally, to the stats, officer will also have either passive perks or active abilities. In the case of passive perks, an officer will get one or two bonuses depending on their category. A comms officer will get a perk for sensors, gunners for weapons etc. But most officer passive perks don't align well with the slot they are supposed to go in. Sensors officers have low aerospace, kinetic weapons officers have low physical stat etc. So what to do in the case a passive perk officer doesn't have the right stat for the job? You place them on your bridge! All flagship specific perks and escort captains will apply their passive perk bonus to the ship, if placed on the bridge. So this will effectively boost all functions on your flagship when you have for example a high mind officer in your fabrication slot, and a fabrication passive perk officer on your bridge. Both the officer slotted into the fabrication slot as the officers placed on the bridge, will apply their bonus for fabrication orders.

## Abilities

Officer also can have active abilities. If an officer have a symbol underneath the stats, it's indicates an active ability. For this to be used, a player needs to place the officer on the bridge and have the right turret equipped on their flagship. The following abilities have been found in the game version (2.37):

### Missile Barrage
Fires a volley of missiles at one target, dealing massive damage. Requires at least one equipped missile turret. Base cooldown: 13 seconds						

### Fusion Missile
Launches a single missile with a heavier than normal payload. Effective agains capital ships. Requires at lease one missile turret. Base cooldown: 13 seconds												

### Repair Burst
Controlled overload of repair module restores armor of nearby ships. Requires at least one equipped  repair module. Base cooldown: 100 seconds						
						
### Ion Cannon Burst
Triggers all of the ship's ion cannons at once. Requires at least one equipped ion cannon. Base cooldown: 13 seconds						
						
### Kinetic Burst
Overclocks the ship's kinetic turrets, increasing firerate. Requires at least one equipped kinetic / mass driver turret. Base cooldown: 10 seconds						
						
### EMP Round:
Fires an EMP capsule, disabling the target ship or squad. Requires at least one equipped  kinetic / mass driver turret. Base cooldown: 13 seconds						
## Leveling Up
Lastly officers can be upgraded to get higher stats and better abilities. Every level increases a stat, with the main stat (the highest the officer has) increasing much more than those who start with a lower amount. Every 10 levels the passive perk or active ability gets an upgrade. For the active abilities the cooldowns will decrease with a small margin. For passive perks the percentage gets better for every 10 levels, or an officer gets an additional passive perk when research the tens of levels. No matter the position the officer is in, leveling them up will always boost their performance in a way (with the exception for bridge officer, in which only level 10, 20 and 30 have any real benefit)

On a side note, it seems that kinetic / mass driver officers also buff the damage for destroyer escorts
